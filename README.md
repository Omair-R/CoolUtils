A small repository that hosts my C++ utility library. It is intended for my own use, but I won't stop you if you wish to use it. 

## Features
- A C++ implementation of the go defer function.
- Several memory allocation schemes: arena, pool, and stack.
- Several design pattern classes: events, safe singlton, and command.
- A logger wrapped around [fmt](https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt)
- Memory allocation tracker.
